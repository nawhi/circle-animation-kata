# Circle Animation Kata (Work in Progress)

## The Problem

Relational databases natively support "cascade delete": in other words, if you delete an entity, its references in other parts of the database will be deleted too.

This is very helpful in more complex applications... like the one we have here.

How can we replicate this behaviour cleanly in pure frontend state?

This repo has an example animation-creation app which works like this:

- Users can add circles to a global store on the right panel.
- Users can position the circles on a canvas and add arbitrary numbers of keyframes, which specify an interpolation position for a given time.
- We imagine there is a render button somewhere that creates the interpolations and produces the finished animation (implementing that is another kata.)

The main behaviour constraint that makes design hard is that when a user deletes a shape from the global store, _it should be automatically removed from all keyframes._

With this in mind, can you architect the app in a way that makes this behaviour automatic?

In other words, were we to scale the app to adding other entity relationships in future (e.g. an interpolation mode for a given circle between keyframes), what's the architecture that requires the minimum amount of code to ensure our circles are still cascade-deleted properly from the right hand panel?

## Starter Code

In `apps/redux` the app is implemented using just Redux and Redux Toolkit. This is your starting point.

You may wish to stick with Redux or migrate to an alternative state management framework.

The repo structure was created with [Create Turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new).

Much of the boilerplate for the frontend was generated by AI tools including:

- [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [Cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh/)
- [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/)
- [v0](https://v0.dev)

Where UI generated using v0 it is marked as such in a comment and you can click through its link to see the original prompt and generation.
